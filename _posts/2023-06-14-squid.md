## MPMS SQUID Magnetometer
_This is a guide on how to center the sample in MPMS SQUID Magnetometer with RSO mode before your actual measurement._

`Click` is when you need to click the bottom on the Computer.

1. **Sample Removal:**
   
    On computer: top bar `Sample` -> `Remove`

    On SQUID:
   
    1. Lower the black knob, twist, such that it connects to the black wire that is attached to the sample plate.
    2. Pull the knob + wire up.
    3. _Close sample chamber (turn the black knob on the chamber to close)_
    4. Pull sample tube out, and swap with the cap (make sure SQUID will not be contaminated).
    5. Swap samples on the sample plate. 

    Optional on computer: `Sample` -> `Remove vent`

3. **Sample loading:**
   
    On SQUID:
   
    1. Swap sample tube with the black cap.
    2. Purge 3 times.
    3. Open sample chamber, and purge again.
    4. Lower the sample, turn the black knob to release the sample. 

    On computer: `Sample` -> `Finished`

   Input sample descriptions. 
â€ƒ
4. **Centering: (for small samples)**

    `Set field`: set field to `10,000` -> `no overshoot`, `HiRes`

    `RSO centering`:
    1. `Parameter` -> `6cm`
    2. `Initialize transport`
    3. `Center`
    4. `Adjust position` -> `auto adjust`  (want center to be 3cm)
    5. `Parameter` -> `3cm`
    6. `Adjust position` -> `auto adjust`  (until the center is at 1.5cm, at least < 1.55cm)
    7. `Close` 
    
    _If not successful, lower temperature to base, and try again._

    _Want to use 3cm for RSO scans, want to use 6cm for DC scans._

5. **Set Temperature**
    1. Run sequence: any Degauss sequence.
    2. Set `100K` with `-5K/min`.
    3. Lower to your target temperature, and start your actual scan.
